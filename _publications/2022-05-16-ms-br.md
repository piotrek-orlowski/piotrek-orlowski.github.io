excerpt: 'Beyond market return risk, investors require compensation for market variance and skewness risk. Negative market skewness can arise from two distinct sources: large, infrequent negative returns, or from the tendency of negative returns to cluster in times of higher volatility. The first feature is typically rationalized with the existence of high-frequency "jumps" or "disasters" in the underlying price process. The second feature is usually called the "leverage effect". While there exists ample robust evidence that priced jump risk accounts for the lion's share of equity and variance risk premia, the relation between the skewness risk premium and the compensation for jump risk was only investigated using model-based approaches. [...] we introduce novel distinguishing notions of realized skewness, which can be replicated with model-free trading strategies and at the same time admit a decomposition into a tradable jump skewness component and a tradable leverage effect component. We analyze the properties of the excess returns of our skewness strategies in the market for S\&P 500 options, both intraday and overnight, in order to learn more about the size of the market skewness risk premium, its seasonal variation when markets are open or closed, and its cyclicality. Summarizing, we find that the skewness risk premium is large, greater when markets are closed than when they are open, countercyclical, and distinct from the variance risk premium. Moreover, during market open hours, when the jump and leverage skewness components can be traded separately with our approach, we find that the skewness risk premium is dominated by priced jump skewness risk.'

## Abstract

Market skewness risk is priced but the components of its premium are not fully understood. We propose new trading strategies decomposing the skewness risk premium into jump and leverage effect components, and we analyze the skewness risk premia in the market for S&amp;P 500 index options. We find that the skewness premium is higher when markets are closed than during trading hours, consistently with uncertainty resolution patterns by non-US investors; that it increases after left-tail market events and that it is distinct from the variance premium. Moreover, during trading hours, the skewness premium is dominated by priced jump risk.
