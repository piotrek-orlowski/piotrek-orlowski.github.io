# excerpt: 'We examine the pricing performance of out-of-sample pricing factors in the broad cross-section of currency returns. To this end, we develop a methodology for estimating empirical minimum-dispersion stochastic discount factors (SDFs) under constraints on maximum position leverage. Under leverage constraints compatible with those observed in the currency markets, our empirical SDFs deliver smaller out-of-sample pricing errors than existing factor models, and are priced in individual currency and hedge fund cross-sections. After transaction costs, an investable SDF portfolio delivers a Sharpe ratio of around 0.8 and positively skewed returns. These empirical SDFs offer tractable benchmarks for candidate currency pricing models.'

## Abstract

Structural models such as Merton (1974) imply that all claims on a firm's assets draw on the same sources of risk. In the simplest case, when asset risk is the only common source of variation, Sharpe ratios for debt and equity must be the same. We study a model where, in addition to asset risk, bond- and shareholders are exposed to asset variance and interest rate risk. In this setting, the predicted Sharpe ratios of debt exceed those of equity for the same firm significantly. We document that this is also the case in a large data set of bond and stock prices.
