excerpt: 'This paper proposes a new measure of tail risk premium obtained from high-frequency stock returns. Risk adjustment is based on a nonparametric estimation of the state price density that tilts the return distribution to satisfy the Euler equation. Empirically, our daily tail risk premium factor extracted from intra-day S\&amp;P 500 returns consistently forecasts the future distribution of market returns, including the mean, higher moments and a large range of quantiles. Among established benchmark measures of tail and variance risk, it appears as the most significant predictor for expected returns on a cross-section of characteristic-based portfolios. Moreover, it is also a robust predictor of the variance risk premia suggesting that investors&apos; aversion to downside risk is also an important determinant of risk premium in high frequency markets.'

## Abstract

We propose a novel measure of the market return tail risk premium based on minimum-distance state price densities recovered from high-frequency data. The tail risk premium estimate extracted from S&amp;P 500 returns predicts the market equity and variance risk premiums and expected excess returns on a cross section of characteristics-sorted portfolios. Additionally, we describe the differential role of the quantity of tail risk, and of the tail premium, in shaping the future distribution of index returns. The results are robust to including established measures of tail and variance risk, and of risk premiums, in the predictive models.
