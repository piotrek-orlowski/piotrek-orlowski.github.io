excerpt: 'We examine the pricing performance of out-of-sample pricing factors in the broad cross-section of currency returns. To this end, we develop a methodology for estimating empirical minimum-dispersion stochastic discount factors (SDFs) under constraints on maximum position leverage. Under leverage constraints compatible with those observed in the currency markets, our empirical SDFs deliver smaller out-of-sample pricing errors than existing factor models, and are priced in individual currency and hedge fund cross-sections. After transaction costs, an investable SDF portfolio delivers a Sharpe ratio of around 0.8 and positively skewed returns. These empirical SDFs offer tractable benchmarks for candidate currency pricing models.'

## Abstract

This paper develops a systematic framework for testing asset-pricing models, with a particular focus on obtaining testable restrictions on the joint distribution of multiple SDFs. Our framework takes an arbitrary set of empirical and/or theoretical restrictions—such as observable returns and Euler equations—as a primitive and returns a family of necessary conditions on the joint distribution of SDFs that have to be satisfied if the model is to be consistent with the a priori specified restrictions. Applying our main results to international asset-pricing models, we show that observed asset prices imply non-trivial restrictions on the comovement of SDFs of different countries.
